			<h1>Wiseman</h1>
			<a id="wiseman"><img src="images/wiseman.png" alt="Wiseman"></a>
			<p><i>All will be silenced in the name of the Doom Phantom!</i></p>
			<p>Wiseman, also known as the Death Phantom and the Doom Phantom, is the master of the Black Moon Clan/Negamoon Family and the true antagonist of Sailor Moon R.</p>
			<p>Wiseman attempted to use the Dark Crystal and Wicked Lady to open the Dark Gate and send dark energy through the planet Earth to destroy it and Wicked Lady, but Sailor Moon and Darien got through to her and she became Rini again. Wiseman revealed himself to be the Doom Phantom and attacked Sailor Moon, who transformed into Princess Serena, or Neo Queen Serenity, and entered a beam struggle with Wiseman. Rini used the Silver Crystal of the future to transform into Princess Rini, and together Serena and Rini unleashed an energy explosion that completely destroyed Wiseman and his true form which he proclaimed it to be his "master", Doom Phantom. The Dark Crystal was decimated along with him.</p>

			<h1>Pharaoh 90</h1>
			<a id="pharaoh"><img src="images/pharaoh90.jpg" alt="Pharaoh 90"></a>
			<p>Pharaoh 90 is the final antagonist of Sailor Moon S, and the one behind all the events. Pharaoh 90 has the appearance of a giant, dark energy orb.</p>
			<p>He had Germatoid possess Doctor Tomoe, and his most powerful servant, Mistress 9, the Sovereign of Silence, possess Tomoe's daughter Hotaru. Mistress 9 and the Bureau of Bad Behavior wanted the Purity Chalice to awaken him, but Sailor Moon got it first.</p>
			<p>Eventually Mistress 9 was able to get the Purity Chalice and awaken Pharaoh 90, who came to Earth. Sailor Moon attacked him, but he was unaffected and blasted her with a red energy wave. He also shot an energy wave at Mistress 9, but Sailor ;Moon protected her, as killing Mistress 9 would kill Hotaru as well. Pharaoh 90 began to bring the Silence about the world to destroy it. Hotaru was able to overpower Mistress 9 from within, destroying her, and awaken as Sailor Saturn. She attempted to destroy Pharaoh 90 from within by destroying his core, but was unable to. Sailor Moon received power from the other Sailor Scouts, transformed into Super Sailor Moon without the Purity Chalice, entered Pharaoh 90, and destroyed his core, completely destroying him.</p>

			<h1>Queen Nehelenia</h1>
			<a id="queennehelenia"><img src="images/queen_nehelenia.jpg" alt="Queen Nehelenia"></a>
			<p><i>I shall never doubt the power of innocent dreamers. I shall never doubt the dreams of innocent children. I shall never doubt my worst nightmare. I shall use the power of innocent dreamers. I shall use the dreams of innocent children. I shall preserve my dreams. My worst nightmare will be somebody's!</i></p>
			<p>Queen Nehelenia was made in a mirror image of Queen Serenity. She became obsessed with staying young and beautiful forever, and looked into her mirror to see her future and saw herself old and ugly. She decided to give everyone else her nightmares, and her fear of becoming ugly took physical form inside the mirror as Zirconia. She transformed all her subjects into the Remless, strange maniacal creatues which would forever become the Dead Moon Circus, and watched Queen Serenity and the Moon Kingdom and decided she wanted to take it over. When she found out about Helios and the Golden Crystal, she tried to take it from him, but was unable to because of her evil intentions, so she imprisoned Helios' body, but was sealed inside her mirror by Queen Serenity.</p>
